A simple project to learn [canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp).

I took [this project](https://github.com/AlexandrGuzenko/AlexandrGuzenko.github.io/tree/gh-pages/game1).

I figured out how the canvas works, commenting the code, made changes  regarding the plot of the game, added scoring, and added improvements to the game in the form of a loss.
